        I really enjoyed the course. The content was well-structured, and the instructor explained everything clearly.\n
        The course exceeded my expectations. The topics were relevant, and I appreciated the practical examples.\n
        It was one of the best courses I've taken. I felt constantly engaged and supported.\n
        The course content was good, but sometimes the pace was a bit fast for me.\n
        I think the materials are okay, but the delivery could be a bit more interactive.\n
        Some topics were interesting, while others felt a bit rushed. Overall, it was decent.\n
        I found the course confusing at times. It would help to have more real-world examples.\n
        The content felt outdated and the lectures were hard to follow.\n
        Honestly, I struggled to stay engaged. The delivery style didn't work well for me.\n
        The course didn't meet my expectations. I felt lost in most of the sessions.\n
